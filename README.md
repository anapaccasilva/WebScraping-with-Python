# WebScraping-with-Python


This project was developed as an evaluative activity for the course 'Integrative Project IV' of the Big Data program and consists of extracting data using WebScrapping techniques, with the BeautifulSoup library, from various pages of the website 'Rotten Tomatoes' containing the 'Best and Worst' tag. Following the extraction, a natural language-based classification was used to identify the articles as lists of 'Best', 'Worst', 'Best and Worst', or 'Others'.
